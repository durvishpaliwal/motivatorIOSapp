# Motivator iOS App

Motivator is a motivational app for iPhone, Apple Watch, and Home Screen widgets.  
Get inspiring quotes delivered throughout your day—on mobile, watch, and widget.
I created it for myself as I did not want to pay for the high money sucking motivational quotes app.

## Features

- **Motivational Quote Widget**  
  Add a widget to your home screen and receive a new quote at your chosen interval.

- **iOS App**  
  Browse or search quotes, save favorites, and customize how/when you receive motivation.

- **Apple Watch App**  
  View motivational quotes anytime right on your wrist.
